# ðŸ§© Practice Set: useRef Hook in React

Test your understanding of the `useRef` hook with these real-world coding challenges.

---

### **1. Auto Focus Input on Button Click**

Create a React component with an input box and a button. When the button is clicked, the input should automatically get focused using `useRef`.

---

### **2. Stopwatch Using useRef**

Build a simple stopwatch that starts and stops using buttons. Use `useRef` to store the timer ID (so you can start and stop it without re-rendering).

---

### **3. Track Previous Value**

Create a component that shows both the current and previous value of an input field using `useRef`.

---

### **4. Render Count Tracker**

Display how many times your component has rendered without causing extra renders â€” track it using `useRef`.

---

### **5. Scroll to Bottom Feature**

Create a list of messages and a button. When clicked, the view should scroll smoothly to the bottom using a ref attached to the last message.

ðŸ’¡ *Hint:* Use `.current` to access and manipulate DOM elements or store values without triggering re-renders.
